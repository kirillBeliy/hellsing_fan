                    Kouta Hirano (平野 耕太, Hirano Kōta) is a renowned Japanese manga artist born on July 14, 1973, in Adachi, Tokyo, Japan. He is best known for his influential works, particularly the manga series Hellsing and Drifters.
                    Hirano began his career as a manga artist's assistant, where he described himself as "horrible" and "lazy." His early works included titles such as Angel Dust, Coyote, and Gun Mania, but it was his groundbreaking series Hellsing that brought recognition. The series debuted in 1997 in the monthly manga magazine Young King OURs and quickly gained popularity for its unique blend of horror, action, and supernatural themes.
                    Before Hellsing, Hirano had published a short story titled The Legends of Vampire Hunter, which served as a precursor to his later work. His storytelling often features strong characters and intricate plots, drawing inspiration from various historical events and mythologies.
                    <br>
                    Following the conclusion of Hellsing in 2008, Hirano launched a new series titled Drifters, which continues to showcase his distinctive style and storytelling prowess. Throughout his career, he has been recognized for his contributions to the manga industry and has developed a dedicated fan base worldwide.
                    In addition to his work in manga, Hirano is known for his involvement in the doujinshi circle GUY-YA. His passion for firearms and military history often reflects in his works, making him a notable figure among fans of action and fantasy genres.
                    Kouta Hirano remains an influential voice in the world of manga, with ongoing projects that continue to captivate audiences.
