                        Alucard was born in the winter of 1431 and bore the name Vlad III Dracula (father - Vlad II Dracul).

                        until his "death" in 1476, at the age of 45.

                        Seras Victoria is a former London police officer who became a member of the Hellsing Organization. 
                        Seras's parents were killed before her eyes when she was still a child. Her father was also a police officer,
                        so Seras was determined to follow in his footsteps, despite the objections of those around her.
                        During her time in the police force, she earned the nickname 'Kitten'.

                        Hans Günsche is a character from the Hellsing Ultimate series, a member of the Millennium military forces and the Waffen-SS.
                        Hans Günsche is the Major's silent, steadfast adjutant and bodyguard. Hans Günsche is a natural-born werewolf,
                        able to transform at will and fight in either human or werewolf form. Just as Alucard is Hellsing's trump card,
                        and Alexander Anderson is Iscariot's, Hans Günsche is Millennium's trump card.м
